//Class which is not having any name is called Anonymous Class


//Following is the example of creation of Object of Child class that is a Anonymous Inner Class which is extending
//Thread Class

//Thread t = new Thread()
//{
//  ...Body of Anonymous Inner class which is extending Parent class(Thread)
//  ... This class may contain more than one abstract method as it does not have a restriction like lamda expressions
//  ... But if we want to use lamda expression instead of anonymous inner class,
//  ... Compulsorily the should only have one abstract method . ONLY THEN IT CAN BE CONVERTED TO LAMDA EXPRESSION
